    "Here we are trying to adjust parameters of a paraphrase model to generate adversarial examples. \n",
    "### Policy gradients \n",
    "The key parameter update equation is $\\theta_{t+1} = \\theta_t + \\alpha \\nabla_\\theta J(\\theta)$, where $\\alpha$ is a step size parameter, the parameter vector $\\theta$ is for a model (here a paraphrase model), and $J$ is a loss function. The time step $t$ depends on the problem specification and we will get to it later. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now in my review I have defined the loss function $J(\\theta) = E_\\pi[r(\\tau)]$. Here: \n",
    "* $\\pi$ is the policy, a probability distribution for the next action in a given state; essentially $p(a_t|s_t)$\n",
    "* $\\tau$ is a trajectory, a specific sequence $s_0, a_0, r_1, s_1, a_1, \\ldots$ of the agent in the game. This starts at time $t=0$ and finishes at time $t=T$. \n",
    "* $r(\\tau)$ is the sum of rewards for a trajectory $\\tau$, or in other words, the total reward for the trajectory. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this loss function higher values are better (which might make it a reward function) and so we might have to invert it at some point. \n",
    "\n",
    "To update parameters we must find the gradient $\\nabla_\\theta J(\\theta)$, which measures how $J(\\theta)$ changes when we adjust the parameters of the paraphrase model. The gradient is simplified through some maths to get the policy gradient theorem $$ \\nabla_\\theta J(\\theta) =  \\nabla_\\theta E_\\pi [r(\\tau)]  = E_\\pi \\left[r(\\tau) \\sum_{t=1}^T \\nabla_\\theta \\log \\pi (a_t|s_t)  \\right] $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate this you need to calculate the expectation term, which in turn means evaluating every possible trajectory $\\tau$ and its expected return. Generally this is not possible and instead we turn to estimators.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One of these is REINFORCE. It gives us  $$ \\nabla_\\theta J(\\theta) \\approx \\sum_{s=1}^S \\sum_{t=1}^T G_t \\nabla \\log \\pi(a_t|s_t)$$ where \n",
    "* $G_t$ is the discounted return and is given by $G_t = r_t + \\beta r_{t-1} + \\beta^2 r_{t-2} + \\dots$. It's a rough estimate of $r(\\tau)$. Rewards obtained later in the episode are weighted much higher than rewards obtained earlier. I guess it assumes that the parameters update every timestep. \n",
    "* $S$ is some number of samples.\n",

    "This is the first implementation we will try. \n",

    "* Actions: each action is \"choosing\" a paraphrase (or of choosing $n$ paraphrases). The set of all possible paraphrases and their probabilities is the policy. So $\\pi(a|s) = p(x'| x;\\theta)$ where $x'$ is the paraphrase (or list of paraphrases). \n",
    "    * To approximate this probability, what we can do is generate a large list of paraphrases, and for each, the probabilities of generating each token in turn for that paraphrase. This gives a rough \"probability\" of how likely that sequence was. This number is kind of like a weight for how good that paraphrase is, according to the model.  We can then turn the weights into probabilities to get a \"probability\" of the paraphrase. This is dependent on the number of paraphrases generated, so generating a large list is likely to be better for this task. \n",
    "* Reward: The paraphrase moves through the reward function $R(x, x')$) to get the reward $r$. \n",

    "There are a few variations to this scenario that we can do. For each of these we will formulate the policy and the reward function $R$. Below, $x'$ means paraphrase, $f(x)_y$ means the model confidence of x for the class of the true label $y$, $SS(a,b)$ is the result of a semantic similarity model run over $a$ and $b$, and $\\lambda$ is a hyperparameter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### One-paraphrase \n",
    "Here we only generate one paraphrase. This scenario also has a few options. First we generate a list of paraphrases with the probabilities of selecting one. Then we either sample probabilistically from the list or pick the most probable option. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the policy $p(x'|x,\\theta)$ is the chance of obtaining a specific paraphrase. For the sampling option this is equal to its sample probability. For the top option this is just the probability of selecting that option. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reward function might look like $R(x,x') = f(x)_y - f(x')_y + \\lambda SS(x, x')$. We could also make the $SS$ factor a step-function above some threshold. \n",

    "The REINFORCE equation $$ \\nabla_\\theta J(\\theta) \\approx \\sum_{s=1}^S \\sum_{t=1}^T G_t \\nabla \\log \\pi(a_t|s_t)$$ becomes $$ \\nabla_\\theta J(\\theta) \\approx \\sum_{s=1}^S  R(x,x'_s) \\nabla \\log p(x'_s|x,\\theta)$$ We repeat the process $S$ times where $S$ is ideally as large as possible. We can start with something simple (e.g. $S=10$ or $S=100$) and go from there.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient term $\\nabla \\log p(x'_s|x,\\theta)$ can hopefully be found with autodiff. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Set of paraphrases\n",
    "In this scenario the paraphrase model is evaluated on performance over a set of paraphrases, which we call $X'$ here. The policy becomes $p(X'|x, \\theta)$, the probability of obtaining that list. We can get this probability by multipling together the \"probability\" of each individual paraphrase, multiplying also by nCr (for r paraphrases out of n total) to account for the lack of order in the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can make a number of sub-scenarios here. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the **top-paraphrase in set** condition the paraphrase generator is only measured on the best reward for a paraphrase in its set. The idea is the generator will learn to produce a diverse set of examples, any of which could plausibly be a good adversarial example. Here we only look at best performing paraphrase $x'_m$, which we can find by $x'_m = \\max_i [f(x)_y - f(x'_i)_y]$, then return $R(x,x'_m) = [f(x)_y - f(x'_m)_y] + \\lambda SS(x,x'_m)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "For the **average-paraphrase in set** condition the paraphrase generator is measured on the average reward of the paraphrases in its set. This encourages the generator to consider performance of all examples more-or-less equally. The reward function could be something like $\\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^k \\left[ f(x)_y - f(x'_i)_y + \\lambda SS(x, x'_i) \\right]$ \n",
    "\n",
    "A combination of these scenarios is the **top-k/top-p\\% paraphrases in set**. Here we only use the top-$k$ paraphrases, or more generally, the top $p$ percentage of paraphrases. \n"

    "### Interpretation 2: Token-level\n",
    "This interpretation is at token-level; it sees choosing the next word as the next time step. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Starting state: $s0 = x$, the initial state. But you also have a \"blank slate\" for the paraphrase. So maybe it's a tuple (x, pp) where pp is a paraphrase with no words. Here x is used as the reference for the paraphrase generator.  \n",
    "* Actions: Choose the next word of p. I guess this starts with the \\<START\\> token (or something similar). Then you have the policy $\\pi(a|s)$ which is the same as $p(w_{next}|pp, x; \\theta)$ where $\\theta$ is the paraphrase model parameters, $pp$ is the so-far constructed sentence, and $w_{next}$ is the next token (I say token because I don't know if this model is on the subword or word basis). \n",
    "* Time steps: every token is generated one-by-one and each of these is allocated a time step. This means probably that you also update the parameters after each token generated too. \n",
    "* Reward. The reward is allocated every token. There are many reward functions (see papers on token-level loss functions). Some also incorporate document-level rewards too. \n",
    "* Next state. $s_1$ is again the tuple $(x, pp)$ but now $pp$ has the first word in it. \n",
    "\n",
    "On *teacher forcing*. This is when you have a ground-truth paraphrase and you can use it when generating tokens. This is useful because if the model makes a mistake it doesn't continue down that track but is adjusted back. This stops big divergences (but also might limit the diversity of generated paraphrases). This is used when training a paraphrase model. You have a set of reference paraphrases that are human provided. Here though we only have the original sentence and no references. We could generate adversarial examples and use that to do teacher forcing. Generating them using textattack recipes might work. This is only really used on the token-level rewards. "
